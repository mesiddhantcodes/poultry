Key practices include ensuring proper cleaning and disinfection of the layer house, providing adequate floor, feeding, and watering space, and maintaining appropriate lighting schedules. For instance, a photoperiod of 16 to 17 hours per day is recommended to sustain optimal egg production. Additionally, implementing a balanced diet tailored to the nutritional needs of layers is essential. Regular health monitoring and adherence to vaccination schedules further contribute to the well-being and productivity of the flock"]}
